A lot of cool stuff has been added to Tailwind since the last time we published any screencasts, so we thought it would be a great idea to record a little series that covers all of the new additions.

["What's new in Tailwind CSS?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-hrxkgkG-s&list=PL5f_mz_zU5eV0_7udNKr3qffGCkJ4Avb_) is a series of 12 short videos that teach you everything you need to know about some of our favorite new Tailwind features.
